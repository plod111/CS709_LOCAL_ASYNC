## FINAL PROJECT THOUGHTS / PLANNING


##### <u>Nov 26, 2023</u>

* Perhaps implement Maven for handling dependancies/references?
  * perhaps more efficient to simply comment/uncomment when/where requried

Implementation:
* Graphical only or with text boxes as well. 
* Buttons for each coin deposited to the machine
* Typing in coordinate of the song. 
* GUI all in one box without switching states.
* Each song should display the title, artist, and cost to play.
* Starting in command line to input songs
* Sort by radio button
* The queue should only add songs if user has enough funds
* Build out each 'Goal set' individually, and then decide on connectivity

Questions to be questioned:
* What is creditPayments vs coinPayments?
* If (credit == credit card) {have user input amount in a textbox.}
* Can we use dictionaries in Java?


Objects:
*
