/**
 * pivotBalancing
 * 
 * Program that attempts to recursively load balance a very tiny one row 
 * airplane, simulated by an 1D array of numbers entered on the
 * command line. Here are the rules:
 *   a. implement recursively.
 *   b. may only swap element n in the array with element length-n-1 
 *     (i.e. the element on the other side of the center).
 *   c. Load is defined as the sum of the elements to the left of the center vs.
 *     the sum of the elements to the right of the center.
 *   d. The load on each side does not have to be exactly the same, it should,
 *     however be as close as possible.
 *   e. You do not need to recurse within the left or right side.
